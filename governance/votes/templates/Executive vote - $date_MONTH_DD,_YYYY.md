The Governance Facilitator(s) and the MakerDAO Smart Contracts Domain Team have placed an Executive Vote into the voting system. MKR Holders should vote for this proposal if they support the following alterations to the Maker Protocol.

### $executive_entry_1

$executive_entry_description_1

### $executive_entry_2

$executive_entry_description_3

### $executive_entry_3

$executive_entry_description_3

## Summary

Therefore, if this Executive proposal passes the following will occur:
- $executive_action_description_1
- $executive_action_description_2
- $executive_action_description_3

This [Executive Vote](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/on-chain-gov) will continue until the number of votes in favor surpasses the votes in favor of the currently leading proposal. This is a [continuous approval](https://community-development.makerdao.com/en/learn/governance/how-voting-works) vote. 

If this executive vote does not pass within 30 days then it will expire and have no effect on the Maker Protocol, even if it should later pass. 

$OfficeHours? Note that this proposal will include an office-hours modifier that means it can only be cast between 14:00 and 21:00 UTC, Monday - Friday. This is to ensure that at least some auction keepers are available to react to unforeseen issues with their bots in the event of early liquidations.


## Review

Community debate on these topics can be found on the MakerDAO [governance forum](https://forum.makerdao.com/). Please review any linked threads to inform your position before voting.

Additionally, these changes may have been discussed further in recent Governance calls. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLzkWCj8ywWNq5-90-Id6VPSsrk4OWVan) for these calls is available to review.

## Action

**Voting for this proposal will place your MKR in support of implementing the changes outlined above.**
